# Offboarding

## Clean up you project boards before you offboard
- Clean up your project board(s)
   - Finish up any issues you have left "In Progress" and move them to "Done"
   - Move any leftover "To Do" items back to the project's backlog
- In your last Daily Standup, let your Scrum Master know your plans for any leftover items on your project boards
   - Will all tickets be completed by EOD? 
   - What are your plans to finish these tickets?
   - Are there any tickets you will work on during first week of Pilot?
- Publish your technical blog post (or set a plan to get it published) before your last day
- Notify the Scrum Master at the end of your last day when you are ready to confirm everything has been left in good shape

>You will be responsible for any "unfinished" issues. Please figure out a plan to complete what you've started before your Pilot start date or finish it within your first week on the Pilot

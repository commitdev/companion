# Post onboarding/pre-pilot

Once you've completed your HOP Demo, your EPX coordinator will ask you to:

1. [Set up a project board](#1-set-up-your-project-board)
1. [Contribute to a project until your Pilot starts](#2-contribute-to-a-project-until-your-pilot-starts)

## 1. Set up your project board
- Decide on what you want to work on:
  - Create a blog article for "Code + Tell" -- teach someone something in 5-10 minutes and it'l be posted as an article on `commit.dev/blog`
   - [Platform](https://github.com/commitdev/helix#platform-wiki) (An internal Commit sponsored application used to help match engineers with startups)
   - [Zero](https://github.com/commitdev/zero#contributing-to-zero) (An open source Commit sponsored project used to help startup engineers set up their infrastructure)
- Create a Github Project Board (see this [example how-to recording](https://github.com/commitdev/ep-contribution-guide/raw/main/how-to-contribute.mp4))
   - Use your first AND last name (ie. Simon Ho) to as the name of your project board
   - Pull in your first issue to work on from the chosen project 
   - Assign yourself the issue
   - **Send the link to your project board to your EPX Channel**
- Start coding/problem solving!
   - Try to work on one issue at a time, moving issues from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done"
   - You will be responsible for keeping your project board up-to-date at all times
  
## 2. Contribute to a project until your Pilot starts
- When you finish the initial ticket, pick up 3 more and so on until your Pilot starts
- Join the [Daily Standup](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82469142067?pwd=cWcvU0lrMFNXeitCbUNybGlPVnZDQT09) to update the Cohort on your progress and experience
   - 10AM PST everyday for 15 minutes during the [Post onboarding/pre-pilot](https://github.com/commitdev/ep-contribution-guide/tree/main#post-onboardingpre-pilot) period
   - At the meeting, the Scrum Master will go through everyone's project board(s) and ask:
     - What did you do yesterday?
     - What will you do today?
     - Any blockers?
   - As part of picking up tickets, we'd also like you to write a short technical blog post about the work you're doing in keeping with our commitment to Working Out Loud (WOL)
     - Work with Simon to identify a relevant topic
     - Log it in the Blog Proposals doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ed4-RVeMUNDDJZvfK7eArJDHjIgl62HuH83b4jK-_Qc/edit) and follow the instructions there 

That's it! Feel free to ping your EPX Coordinator if you need help with anything else.
